# Dude, What's My GePeUwu

A mod that tells what GPU you're using for Minecraft from the Menu screen and in your logs, useful to not need to launch 
the game constantly into singleplayer/multiplayer and joining to see from F3 screen.

Especially useful if you have a dual GPU laptop or tower and trying to figure out what GPU is your Minecraft using. 
[looking at you iGPU + dGPU laptop users]
