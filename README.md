# Dude, What's My GePeUwu

A mod that tells what GPU you're using for Minecraft from the title screen and in your logs, thus letting you avoid the annoyance that is loading into a world and pressing f3 to find out what your GPU is.

Can be very useful if you have a dual GPU laptop or tower and trying to figure out what GPU is your Minecraft using!
